# Table API - Creating table - a simple example


<p>This example shows you how to create a table programmatically and apply formatting to the table, and to individual columns within the table. Then it loads data from the file system, displaying a directory listing of all the files in your C:\ folder, along with formatted size and modification date values. The resulting document should look like the one in the picture below (with different file names). </p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/table-api-creating-table-a-simple-example-e3242/14.2.3+/media/4f471058-4f6e-4c26-847c-c894ae4baabd.png"></p>
